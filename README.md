# Android Malware Family Detection Based on Few-Shot Learning

This document serves as a supplementary file :file_folder: for the malware family detection of the Androzoo and Drebin datasets. It includes the datasets, feature sets, and experimental results for various evaluation metrics. Additionally, it provides the source code.

The purpose of this work is to conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of the effects of family detection based on few-shot learning. This encompasses a variety of methods, such as sampling, data augmentation, transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal learning.

Furthermore, the study delves into the selection and optimization of network models within the siamese network framework. This exploration is crucial for enhancing the performance of malware family detection.
